Perks:
- Gain access to new features under development before they are publicly released
- Gain knowledge of upcoming features and fixes before anyone else
- Get to be a part of an exclusive team
- Get to play with features in test environments

Requirements:
- Must be a mature person
- Must be an active Second Life resident (online 2 hours daily minimum)
- Must attend weekly meetings
- Must actively test new features and report your findings
- Understand that your game may be affected by unstable code
