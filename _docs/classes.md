There are many classes to play within the SLColonies RPG's. Classes can vary between world owners and different RPG's, but in general here we talk about our main project **The Counter Earth**.

Each class has benefits and are designed to suit different player styles. Those that enjoy combat focused characters can do so and receive benefits to them in combat. While those that enjoy farming also has roles suited to such.
There are also roles which are crafting focused and some that are exploration, trade focused. Below are some examples of classes used, but if you would like to know all the classes available in our main game [The Counter Earth](http://thecounterearth.com) then please visit its website at [www.thecounterearth.com](http://thecounterearth.com).

Here are some examples of classes available and their explicit benefits:

### Peasant
Peasants are classified as the farmers. They have access to watering and harvesting various types of fields. They also have explicit access to the flour mills, pottery and basket weaving. They are skill based in that the higher their skill, the less time it will take for a peasant to craft or harvest.

### Miners
Miners are the men and women who love to work down in the caves. They have explicit access to the various mineral ores and will gain access to higher grade ores over time as their skill progresses. Increasing skills also reduces the time to mine a node. Miners are needed to supply ores to the blacksmiths.

### Blacksmith
Explicit access to the blacksmith table which allows the creation of many tools, equipment, weapons and shields. Skilling up will open up more recipes and allow a smith to make items that lower skilled smiths will not be able to.

### Carpenter
Explicit access to the carpentry tables which allows the creation of various tools, equipment, weapons, furniture and decorations for the RPG worlds. Skilling up in this class will open up more recipes over time.

### Woodsman
Woodsman live in the woods and are not only your lumberjacks, but also have explicit access to sawmills for creating planks of wood. They are also able to create the various sizes of wood planks used by carpenters. 

### Hunter
While anyone can hunt animals and bring their carcasses back for trade, only hunters have the explicit ability to use hunters tables. Hunters tables are a little like butchers tables, though they allow a hunter to split the carcass up into its bare materials, such as meat portions, furs, skins, feathers and so forth. 

### Herbalist
Again, while anyone can go around collecting plants, mushrooms and other goods around the lands for trade, only the herbalist, who is also considered a healer, can use a herbalist/apothacary table to create various potions and concuctions that produce certain effects - whether they be healing, damaging, poisoning and so forth. Many of these ingredients can be traded further to use with other trades, such as traded to a smith to make weapons with special effects, like extra damage, critical damage chance, fire damage, ice damage, poisoning effects and so on. Some of the effects can be used in cooking recipes also.

### Merchant
Merchants are the men and women who love to travel around the world, buying cheap, selling high. They have the ability to use fast travel methods like the ships, for a discounted price. They also receive discounts in buying and selling from NPCs over time as they skill up, and they also have the explicit ability to rent market stalls in the various cities and villages to trade their wares. These market stalls are the only vendors which can sell the final crafted 'physical' form of products. Such as all the foods, weapons, furniture, equipment, tools and so forth. NPC vendors on the other hand focus only on database raw resources and compound ingredients which cannot be rezzed in-world.

### Brewer
Brewers focus on the alcoholic beverages of the realm, such as Wines & Whiskies. The greater the skill, the better recipes they gain access to for making drinks that affect stats in higher numbers and of higher qualities. Some drinks can be made to give boost to certain stats suh as an energy boost or even lower stats such as poison damage. 

### Cook
Cooks gain access to higher quality recipes in the various cooking tables found across the lands - including the baking table. Unlike regular players, you will gain access to recipes which combine higher quality ingredients and output foods which affect the meter in much greater ways. You've even be able to craft foods which have other special effects, considered buffs and debuffs.

### Warrior
This class gains an increase in base damage you will do with weapons as well as armour rating which lowers damage caused in combat. It will scale with skill over time.

### Base Skills
All players are able to combat and all players are able to cook. However, in combat you will not gain extra base damage or armour rating or skill up unless you are a warrior. For cooking, you will only have access to the most basic of cooking recipes using basic ingredients. A proper cook has the ability to make the valuable and most filling and effective of foods.

We are also working on fishing that anyone will be able to do to relax and gain a basic way of getting themselves free food they can cook and eat to stay alive out in the wild. 

You may be asking yourself why we do not just make everything a skill and allow players to build up any of the above skills and make anything they want, when they want. Well, it was extremely important to us that we make a fully functional currency system. That means, items have to have actual demand and have value. If any player can go get any resource, then there is no real need for trade. Power players will create everything and own the markets all on their own - whilst those that focus on a few trades will make no income at all.

By making each profession its seperate thing, we are enforcing that each profession needs other profession to make end product. This means, a cook needs the peasants work to get their flours, milks and eggs, or a hunter for their meats. A merchant needs to go out and visit all the various professions and markets in order to obtain a good amount of stock for trading and moving around the vast world. It stops the possibility of power players that make everything and has a profession that requires input ingredients to visit the markets and purchase said ingredients which they can then use to make a more valuable end product to make a profit from. Also, because end products which can be rezzed have no NPC markets, it is in the best interest to interact with Merchants & Traders who have the ability to purchase these goods in bulk and sell in the markets which they as Merchants can explicitly rent. Relying on other players who are busy in their own trades to purchase end products from you direct will not be as efficient! You will find that locals will buy direct from you, but if Merchants purchased from you, they have the ability to travel the lands cheaply and seed products in the various village and city markets! 

If you tried to do the art of trading on the own, you will find that you will either be spending too much coin on travelling by ship, or risking being robbed by travelling through the lands of outlaws whose main focus is combat and PvP!
