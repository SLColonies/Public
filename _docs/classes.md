There are many classes to play within the SLColobies RPG's. Classes can vary between world owners and different RPG's, but in general here we talk about our main project **The Counter Earth**.

Each class has benefits and are designed to suit different player styles. Those that enjoy combat focused characters can do so and receive benefits to them in combat. While those that enjoy farming also has roles suited to such.
There are also roles which are crafting focused and some that are exploration, trade focused. Below are some examples of classes used, but if you would like to know all the classes available in our main game [The Counter Earth](www.thecounterearth.com) then please visit its website at [www.thecounterearth.com](www.thecounterearth.com). More in-depth information, including recipes are all detailed there. 

Here are some examples of classes available and their explicit benefits:

### Peasant
Peasants are classified as the farmers. They have access to watering and harvesting various types of fields. They also have explicit access to the flour mills, pottery and basket weaving. They are skill based in that the higher their skill, the less time it will take for a peasant to craft or harvest.

### Miners
Miners are the men and women who love to work down in the caves. They have explicit access to the various mineral ores and will gain access to higher grade ores over time as their skill progresses. Increasing skills also reduces the time to mine a node.

### Blacksmith
Explicit access to the blacksmith table which allows the creation of many tools, equipment, weapons and shields. Skilling up will open up more recipes and allow a smith to make items that lower skilled smiths will not be able to.

### Carpenter
Explicit access to the carpentry tables which allows the creation of various tools, equipment, weapons, furniture and decorations for the RPG worlds. Skilling up in this class will open up more recipes over time.

### Hunter
While anyone can hunt animals and bring their carcasses back for trade, only hunters have the explicit ability to use hunters tables. Hunters tables are a little like butchers tables, though they allow a hunter to split the carcass up into its bare materials, such as meat portions, furs, skins, feathers and so forth. 

### Herbalist
Again, while anyone can go around collecting plants, mushrooms and other goods around the lands for trade, only the herbalist, who is also considered a healer, can use a herbalist/apothacary table to create various potions and concuctions that produce certain effects - whether they be healing, damaging, poisoning and so forth. Many of these ingredients can be traded further to use with other trades, such as traded to a smith to make weapons with special effects, like extra damage, critical damage chance, fire damage, ice damage, poisoning effects and so on. Some of the effects can be used in cooking recipes also.

### Merchant
Merchants are the men and women who love to travel around the world, buying cheap, selling high. They have the ability to use fast travel methods like the ships, for a discounted price. They also receive discounts in buying and selling from NPCs over time as they skill up, and they also have the explicit ability to rent market stalls in the various cities and villages to trade their wares. These market stalls are the only vendors which can sell the final crafted 'physical' form of products. Such as all the foods, weapons, furniture, equipment, tools and so forth. NPC vendors on the other hand focus only on database raw resources and compound ingredients which cannot be rezzed in-world.

### Brewer
Brewers focus on the alcoholic beverages of the realm, such as Wines & Whiskies. The greater the skill, the better recipes they gain access to for making drinks that affect stats in higher numbers and of higher qualities. Some drinks can be made to give boost to certain stats suh as an energy boost or even lower stats such as poison damage. 

### Warrior
This class gains an increase in base damage you will do with weapons as well as armour rating which lowers damage caused in combat. It will scale with skill over time.

### Base Skills
All players are able to combat and all players are able to cook. Cooking skill will rise the more you cook, which will open up more special recipes. All players also have access to non-alcoholic beverage recipes which affect stats in various ways.
