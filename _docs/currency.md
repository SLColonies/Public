The currency symbol on the player HUD allows you to trade coins with other nearby players. Simply select who you'd like to give coins to, followed by how many.

The currency in SL Colonies is completely player driven. Almost anything in game is crafted by the players, all the way through to the coins used as currency. Of course, some measures are put in place to stop just anyone minting official coins and flooding the economy, causing uncontrollable inflation. The global economy, known as SLC Coin are produced by the game creators. Market orders will be put in place to mint more coin into the system when and as needed. 

Players can purchase in-game coin using Linden Dollars (L$) by visiting the ATM at the SLColonies Main Store. This is based on supply & demand, which means if no one is selling coin for L$, then there are no coins available at the ATM.
Players can also sell their coins for L$, again based on supply and demand. 

Value of coins to L$ then is completely player driven again and will go up and down based on demand and inflation.

**NOTE:** The only location where  in-game currency can be purchased using L$ is the ATM at the SL Colonies Main Store. This is to protect any L$ put into escrow from vanishing due to abuse.
