Fishing Pools are locations which players can gather fish and other rare items from using their fishing rod tool. Users have a chance of catching different types of fish used in cooking as well as the chance of finding rare items, such as more tools, recipe formulas and more. 

You will need multiple of these on your land. Each pool can be used by 1 user at a time, and they do not have to go into SL Water. These can be rezzed anywhere on your land.

As the owner of this item, you can set an unlimited number of respawn locations that the item will reappear after each fishing attempt (see the video).
