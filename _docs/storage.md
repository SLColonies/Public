The storage chest is an essential utility for power gamers and traders. Players get a standard 50 stacks/slots for items and experience fatigue when over-burdened. Players can negate this by buying storage chests which allow the storage of up to 20 stacks/slots of items. If you are a trader or collector, having multiple of these units to categorize your inventory is very handy.

**Price:** L$500<br>
