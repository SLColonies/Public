The SLColonies HUD has been designed with simplicity yet beauty in mind. Player's can control all of their characters needs through the HUD. 

The default display of the HUD just shows the player profile and the health and energy bars. The health bar will drop if you lost health through damage in combat, or if you've depleted one of your other [stats](https://slcolonies.com/docs/stats/). Energy will deplete as you perform tasks, such as gathering, crafting, running or flying. Your energy bar will automatically regenerate slowly when idle. This process can be increased by sitting on chairs and beds.

**Cost:**: L$0 - FREE<br>
