The rental server allows land owners to rent out land, storefronts, stalls, homes or whatever they like for SLC Currency. Land owners can choose any crafted economy.

Land owners can also setup taxes on rentals so that land barons who run a 'sub rental' server automatically pay the owner of the RP land (such as a king or queen) a portion of the income.

**Price:** L$1,000<br>
