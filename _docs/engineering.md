The SLC engineering Table allows players to create weapon part 'molds' which can be brought to the Carpenter or Smith to make weapon parts before bringing them to the weapon crafting station to make the final weapons.

You can also bring items to this table to 'reverse engineer' any item you have to find out what ingredients are involved in them (though this will not tell you the amount of each ingredient within, and you will still need to guess this).


**Price:** L$600<br>
