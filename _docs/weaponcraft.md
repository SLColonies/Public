The Weapon Crafting Table is the final stage of weapon production. When you have made the individual weapon parts at either the Forge & Anvil or the Carpenter (depending what material your parts are made of), you can then bring those multiple parts to this table, mix and match weapon parts and invent new weapons (if that combination has not already been used!). If the combination has been used, you still get the weapon, you just cannot name it.

These finished weapons are wearable and can be used against huntable animals, monsters and in PvP within SLColonies if PvP is enabled in the players HUD.
