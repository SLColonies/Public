The following members of the Second Life community are the people behind the scenes who are working and have worked extremely hard to bring to you SL Colonies.

## Temujin Calidius (attila.katana)
While I am the initial mind behind the creation of SL Colonies, we would not have gotten where we are today without the great team backing me up. Mind you, it took almost a year to find the right guys for the job and many months went there where there was no progress what so ever before finding these brilliant, passionate people. 

Many people in Second Life have the skills and ability, however RL always comes first and only a select few can commit to such a project on a full time basis and really put in the hours into something like this to make it come to fruition.

I cannot thank the guys below, Drakkhis and Joel for being here and for making this a reality!

If you'd like to read more into why I decided to create SL Colonies and what the ideas behind it were, please read the Introduction section.

## Drakkhis Skaeren (drakkhis resident)
Drakkhis is from Belgium (originally the U.S.) and it's unbelievable how much we see eye to eye on so many aspects of the system. In many ways, he's come up with brilliant ideas which has made SL Colonies into something even more brilliant and intense than even I had originally anticipated. 

He had challenged himself in areas that he had never attempted before and learned new languages and scripting methods to make this all work.

We have brought things into SL that we would think not possible and would belong in a full fledged MMORPG. But guess what - it's happened, and it's here!

## Joel Barrameda (meshmafiax resident)
Joel is from the Phillipines! I met Joel a while ago when I had my Myrkvior Fjord sim build and was seeking a mesh creator to make me 9 different barrel designs when I was into the G&S system by Sombra Magic (great system btw) - his work was exceptional quality, better than any other designers I had tried to hire.

Since then and explaining to him the full concept of SL Colonies and showing him where we wish to go with it, he has come on board on a full time basis for this project and has been hard at work designing all the mesh items, from resources, to crafting stations and everything to do with SL Colonies!

His unique ability to see eye to eye with all my descriptions and desires of objects I wish to make come to life for the project is phenomenal. A few words, a description of the concept of what I'd like to see and maybe an example photo from Google images which gives him to ability to understand what I am seeking is all that is needed. Once he got the 'theme' and 'feel' of what we were going for, his ability to come up with 1 or 2 concepts/drafts and be spot on with what we want has made him absolutely awesome!
