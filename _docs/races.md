There are many races to chose from in SLColonies and all of them come with starting stats. You can change your race, however this will cost you half of whatever CXP (Crafting Experience) you have earned. 

There are 6 traits that each race has. Humans are the most balanced race, having 0 to all stats across the board. For any +1 or more stat added to a race, the same must be removed from other stats to bring the total back to zero. For example:

| Race  | Str | Dex | Con | Int | Wis | Char| Total|
|:-----:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:----:|
| Lycan |  2  |  0  |  2  | -1  | -1  | -2  |   0  |
