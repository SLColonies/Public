There are many races to chose from in SLColonies and all of them come with starting stats. You can change your race, however this will cost you half of whatever CXP (Crafting Experience) you have earned. 

There are 6 traits that each race has. Humans are the most balanced race, having 0 to all stats across the board. For any +1 or more stat added to a race, the same must be removed from other stats to bring the total back to zero. For example:

| Race  | Str | Dex | Con | Int | Wis | Char| Total|
|:-----:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:----:|
| Lycan |  2  |  0  |  2  | -1  | -1  | -2  |   0  |

## The Stats
{% include image.html img="hudnew.png" alt="SLC HUD" caption="SL Colonies HUD" %}
Some traits will affect the meter directly, such as constitution will increase player total health and energy, while dexterity would affect total energy and fatigue.

Other stats like strength might affect total damage per hit using hand held weapons while dexterity might also increase damage on ranged weapons.

Some stats will increase ability to open areas, use certain tools, craft certain objects, barter better in markets and so forth.

All these skills can also be included in your roleplay. The slide down stats bar showing your characters traits all have dice icons which you can use to 'roll' like D&D for combat and roleplay purposes. SL Colonies is not focused on PvP combat and therefore has opted for more player vs environment and old school roleplay based PvP which is much more interactive and demanding. 

Here is a quick outline of what each stat means which I found online, you may enjoy this one:

- Strength is being able to crush a tomato.
- Dexterity is being able to dodge a tomato.
- Constitution is being able to eat a bad tomato.
- Intelligence is knowing a tomato is a fruit.
- Wisdom is knowing not to put a tomato in a fruit salad.
- Charisma is being able to sell a tomato based fruit salad.

All of these traits will change over time within each race. What they do and what they effect and by how much will change as we balance. But this will give you an idea for now on what we are intending.

### Strength
These characters are more combat focused due to their increase damage using hand held weapons. Usually this is paired with the constitution trait, but not always. Strength can also affect a players ability to enter through certain doors and rooms which require this stat to enter.

### Dexterity
Dexterity is pretty much the same as a players agility and ability to move fast and hide behind corners. This trait will increase or decrease a players total energy and fatigue meter survival stats. Dexterity will also increase damage on hand held weapons such as bows, crossbows and the likes.

### Constitution
Constitution is the total 'tank' of a player. Usually for warrior types and will increase or decrease a players total health and blood levers in the meters survival stats.

### Intelligence
Intelligence does not affect the meter directly. Instead it is the stat which basically determines how much a character knows. This stat is needed for professions which require a lot of knowledge and has many recipes to remember! It can of course also be used to seal certain rooms for lower level players and during RP situations using dice rolls.

### Wisdom
Wisdom is the life experience. You can know as much as you know with knowledge, but without the life experience you you're just a walking encyclopedia that doesn't know what to do with the knowledge when the time comes. Usually wisdom and intelligence go hand in hand together. 

### Charisma
Charisma is your ability to persuade people. This skill comes in handy for traders and people who like to travel and barter. While this skill also wont directly affect a meter, it will be used to provide discounts on taxes and fees paid in markets and vendors.

## The Races

each race has base stats which affect the meter in one way or another. They will also effect certain items that you come across in the system and be made available to crafters. For example, a carpenter might craft a door which can only be access with someone with x amount of a particular stat chosen by the owner of the door.

As you will see below, every stat is balanced so that the end result always gives a total of 0. If you have +2 strength, you would need -2 in one of the other weighted stats with a weight of 2, or 2 of the sub stats. IE: +2 strength, -2 dexterity = 0 total. Or, +2 strength, -1 Intelligence, -1 Charisma = 0

Player can upgrade their stats by visiting the player station in the main store and these are the stats which affect certain attributes:
Each point or lack of a point thereof, gives the player +5 or -5 in the stat. IE: +1 strength will increase a players Hunger and blood by 5.

Strength = +5 Hunger & +5 Blood<br>
Dexterity = +5 Energy & +5 Fatigue<br>
Constitution = +5 Health & +5 Energy & +5 Poison<br>
Intelligence = +5 Thirst & +5 Fatigue<br>
Wisdom = +5 Poison & +5 Blood<br>
Charisma = +5 Hunger & +5 Thirst
