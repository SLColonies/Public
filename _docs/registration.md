In this video we discuss how a new player obtaining our hud registers into the system and selects their Gender and [Race](https://slcolonies.com/docs/races/). Make sure you check out the [races](https://slcolonies.com/docs/races/) page see what starting trairs are affected with your choice. If you have an idea for a race that is not there, please put in the request on our [forums](https://forum.slcolonies.com) and include what [stats](https://slcolonies.com/docs/races/) you believe would make sense for that race.
