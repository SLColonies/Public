The Furniture Station brings a variety of professions together within SLColonies, to make finished furniture that you can rez in-world and use in your builds.

These include beds that regenerate energy, fatigue, health and potentially other stats, chairs, cushions, storage chests, tables, doors and a variety of other items as we add them to the system.

Any profession can use the furniture station, but the items needed to put together the furniture require a range of occupations, from Farmer, Ranger, Seamstress, Carpenter and more.
