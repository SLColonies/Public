SL Colonies is a survival based roleplaying game the has you as an explorer fully immersed in unique environments. To survive, you must eat, drink and rest. To eat, you must hunt or gather. 
You may trade your gathered goods for coin to upgrade your gear or make your own. You may learn a craft or profession and achieve knowledge that others have not. Becoming well known in your village and surrounds as the man or woman to go to for others needs. 

You can farm and harvest. Breed & butcher. You can be a sword, a warrior, a mercenary for hire if you care not to use your hands for much more. 

The limit is your imagination.

SL Colonies encourages fellow sim owners to join the network and community. Each land has its own rules and cultures, however are still part of the community as a whole. 
Every herb, plant, ore and gathered item are rezzed randomly around each participating region and have rarity values. Some items will be specific to certain regions and extremely rare to find. Others will only be found within certain alliances to encourage trade & combat between others regions.

Everything crafted relies on ingredients. Some common, some rare. Many items have a lifespan when unused to prevent hoarding and increase value based on rarity.
