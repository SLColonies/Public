SL Colonies is a survival based roleplaying game that has you as an explorer fully immersed in unique environments. To survive, you must eat, drink and rest. To eat, you must hunt or gather. 
You may trade your gathered goods for coin to upgrade your gear or make your own. You may learn a craft or profession and achieve knowledge that others have not. Becoming well known in your village and surrounds as the man or woman to go to for others needs. 

You can farm and harvest, hunt & butcher. You can be a sword, a warrior, a mercenary for hire if you care not to use your hands for much more. 

The limit is your imagination.
