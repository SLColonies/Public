Joining SLColonies is easy. If you are a player, all you need to do is to grab yourself a [HUD](https://marketplace.secondlife.com/p/SLC-Survival-RPG-HUD-Meter/18945944), which you can get [here](https://marketplace.secondlife.com/p/SLC-Survival-RPG-HUD-Meter/18945944). Then, you need to find a land that uses the system and has a region server and crafting tables, you can find that list at [https://meter.slcolonies.com](https://meter.slcolonies.com). Once you've done that, you can start roleplaying and learning the system!

If you'd like to join as a sim and get yourself listed on our [website](https://meter.slcolonies.com), you will need to grab yourself a [Region Server](https://slcolonies.com/docs/regionserver/). Get yourself acquainted with everything else we offer for your RPG sim while you are on that page as well.

Everything you need is listed on our main website [https://www.slcolonies.com](https://www.slcolonies.com) right [here](https://www.slcolonies.com), and if you need help with anything, you can join our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/nAgxReW) or our [Forums](https://forum.slcolonies.com) to discuss and get in touch with the rest of our community.

We wish you all the best and look forward to having you join us!


**The SLColonies Team!**
