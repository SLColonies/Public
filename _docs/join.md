> **NOTE**: If you are seeking to join your land to **The Counter Earth** RPG, please visit https://www.worldanvil.com/w/the-counter-earth-temujin-calidius/a/join-the-counter-earth-article instead. 

The SLColonies system is not for sale on the Second Life Marketplace as a package. It is protected code which we have worked hard to make what it has become. We do however, offer solutions for land owners that wish to start their own RPG which is not connected to The Counter Earth RPG as a new project. Those landowners that wish to join The Counter Earth RPG as to visit the link above instead for information.

We can help design your RPG and modify our meter to suit your world, but we cannot sell you a full perm version of the code or allow you to have modify rights to it. 

We will offer:
- Modification of the meter coding to suit your RPG
- Complete rewrite of your world resources/ingredients
- Customisation of crafting stations, recipes and output products
- Modification of meter stats, names, generation/degeneration rates
- Modification of the in-game currency
- Web Hosting
- Database Hosting
- Code updates & maintenance
- Much More

Please get in touch with us using the [Contact Form](http://slcolonies.com/contact/) to discuss. 

Pricing varies and depends on the amount of work required to get your RPG up to scratch.
