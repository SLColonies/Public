Crafting within the SLColonies RPG's comes in numerous forms. There are crafting tables for many different professions out there, such as:
- Smithing Tables
- Carpentry Tables
- Pottery Making
- Basket Weaving
- Sawmills
- Bakery Tables
- Potion Tables
- Much More

There really is no limit to crafting abilities. They even go down to fermentation processes, distilleries, mills etc. The RPG games will evolve and develope their own crafting needs based on the RPG being played and their themes.

All crafting tables require input ingredients/resources of various numbers and types to create output products. Output products can either be compound ingredients which again need to be further crafted, or they can be final products. Final products are the types of products which can be rezzed in world and used. These include food, drinks, potions, first aid, tools, equipment, weapons, furniture, decorations, clothes. If you can think of it, it can be added to an RPG and become part of the game.

Some crafting tables require you to be of a certain class to be permitted to make use of it. And some recipes within will only be available to you at certain skill levels in that class.

> Crafting tables differ in every RPG game using SLColonies. But if you'd like to learn about crafting used in our main project [The Counter Earth](http://thecounterearth.com) - please visit its website [www.thecounterearth.com](http://thecounterearth.com) for more information.
