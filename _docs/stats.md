The HUD in SL Colonies is split up in various stats which are survival based and will require you to interact with the environment as well as others in order to survive.

## Health (HP)
Your health bar is a display of hitpoints. If it reaches 0, you will die. It can be drained due to other effects from your stats (such as losing all your blood or being poisoned) or through combat. 

If you have 100% energy points, you will automatically regain 5 health points every 5 minutes. The only way to speed up the process if to sleep in a bed or to visit a healers bed.

## Energy Points (EP)
Your energy points can be thought of as stamina. It is a bar that scales up and down based on what you are doing around the environment. If you are running, such as during combat, your energy bar will slowly drain. If you are in combat and swinging your weapon around and blocking, it will also slowly drain. If you allow your Energy Points to hit 0%, your character will begin to use health points instead (1 health point per 5 minutes - you will be dead in 8 hours if you do not get your Energy Points back up to more than 0), and you will not be able to keep participating in combat.

Your energy points will automatically regenerate at a steady pace if they have at least 1 point of every other stat (Hunger, Thirst, Tiredness, Blood, Sickness). The current regeneration rate is 50 energy points every 5 minutes. There are certain effects however that can stop your Energy Points from regenerating and in turn drain it to a point that you will actually lose HP. Such as Hunger and Thirst. 

If any of the other stats fall to 0, your energy will stop automatically regenerating. You are able to regenerate energy using other means, such as sitting down on chairs or drinking energy based drinks, such as coffee's. 

## Hunger
Hunger is a thing within SL Colonies. Hunger will drain by 1 point every 5 minutes. That means that in 8 hours of active play time without eating, your character will begin to starve. While your character is starving, it will begin to chew into your Energy Point stat - 1 point every 5 minutes (another 8 hours). Once it is done going through Energy Points, it will take away 1 point of Health every 5 minutes (8 hours). This gives you 24 hours of doing absolutely nothing during your active time before your character falls unconscious.

Some foods come with buffs & debuffs. Such as increasing your Energy and locking it in place for a while for combat. Some will increase thirst/hunger or tiredness. Some foods can even be poisoned!

Drink a beer to reduce your thirst, but at the same time, increase your tiredness perhaps?

**NOTE:** If more than 1 of your stats hits 0, the loss of Energy/HP will be quicker! ie: If you are both Starving and Dehydrating, instead of losing 1 point of EP per 5 minutes, you will lose 2!

## Thirst
This works the same way as Hunger in that you need to drink to keep hydrated. 

Thirst will drain by 1 point every 5 minutes. That means that in 8 hours of active play time without drinking, your character will begin to dehydrate. While your character is dehydrated, it will begin to chew into your Energy Point stat - 1 point every 5 minutes (another 8 hours). Once it is done going through Energy Points, it will take away 1 point of Health every 5 minutes (8 hours). This gives you 24 hours of doing absolutely nothing during your active time before your character falls unconscious.

**NOTE:** If more than 1 of your stats hits 0, the loss of Energy/HP will be quicker! ie: If you are both Starving and Dehydrating, instead of losing 1 point of EP per 5 minutes, you will lose 2!

## Blood
This stat determines how much blood is flowing in your veins. It must be kept at 100% at all times. Any less and it will cause your blood to slowly trickle over time until you have complete blood loss. If your blood hits 99%, it will trickle down 1 point every 5 minutes. 

Once your blood drops to 0, your Health Points will begin to degenerate by 1 point every 5 minutes.

You can experience blood loss by getting cut during combat, or falling from heights, as well as traps placed around various places.

## Sickness
You can get sick via numerous ways in SL Colonies. Poison traps, poison arrows and coated blades. As well as poisoned foods and drinks.

You need to keep this bar at 100% at all times. If you are poisoned, your bar will decrease by 1 point every 5 minutes until it hits 0 (8 hours). Once you hit 0, your health bar will begin to drain by 1 point every 5 minutes (8 hours).

Different poisons can effect your sickness bar in different ways. Such as a slow poison, or a fast poison or even instant poisons depending on their potency and rarity. Some poisons used by Assassins can even kill instantly.

The only way to cure sickness is to see a healer and take the right antidote or medicine for the sickness you have contracted. 

## Tiredness
Tiredness is separate to your Energy Points in that it is a stat which determines your characters overall tireness and lack of sleep. You will become tired and require rest to regenerate. Your characters needs to lay in a bed to regenerate this stat.

The only way to reduce tiredness is to sleep in a bed. Some foods & drinks will have buffs to instantly wake you up again. Such as stimulants (coffee), which might also stop your energy bar from draining for a period of time as well.
