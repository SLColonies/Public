SL Colonies was conceived from various ideas over years of research and testing of many games and systems from within Second Life and outside. 

I have enjoyed Second Life systems such as DG, G&S & DFS for many years. Even played around with Life2, Unity and combat systems like GM, GCS, zCS, DCS. I know right? They all sounds the exact same!

Well, from all of these systems I put together their pro’s and con’s and thought to myself; what would I want within my own lands to make the perfect system that not only integrates everything I want, but encourages interaction and roleplay between the residents in my own communities. 

So, what is SL Colonies, and how is it different to everything else out there? 

SL Colonies is a survival based roleplaying game that has you as an explorer fully immersed in unique environments. To survive, you must eat, drink and rest. To eat, you must hunt or gather. 
You may trade your gathered goods for coin to upgrade your gear or make your own. You may learn a craft or profession and achieve knowledge that others have not. Becoming well known in your village and surrounds as the man or woman to go to for others needs. 

You can farm and harvest, hunt & butcher. You can be a sword, a warrior, a mercenary for hire if you care not to use your hands for much more. 

The limit is your imagination.

The biggest point of difference is that this meter and system is not sold to anyone like others. That means, all resources, supply & demand are controlled at a game level. Many systems allow for customers to purchase all the farming goods, gathering ingredients (resources) which all sounds well and good and does allow for a much larger community, however it also greatly reduces the value of goods in the community as there is no control. Any Tom, Dick or Harry can purchase everything (whoever has the most L$ wins!) and can setup a mass production farm on land that has nothing to do with the theme and feel of the whole system. They then sell everything on the marketplace and the once active and thriving roleplay communities just go down the drain.

How do we fix this? How do we make it so resources are valuable and so that in-game currency is actually valuable enough to use in home rentals and so forth, knowing that your players worked hard to gather those resources - put real time in and has a real value next to that time and work involved?

Well, the only things we plan on possibly making publicly available are such things as crafting stations, cooking ovens and so forth. These things require input ingredients to produce end products, and to get those input ingredients you must travel and explore those lands (like The Counter Earth) who has such supplies available.

Certain pre-approved lands that fit into the grand theme of the RPG will have the opportunity to join into our world. These approved sims will go through rigorous planning with the creators of this RPG. It will be decided which resources would be realistic to find in that zone, how much will those resources affect other regions based on population in the game (supply & demand) - how rare should resources be in that zone and should there be any special resources that can only be found in that new zone to encourage trade between zones? Once a sim has gone through this process and a plan has been put together, construction can begin.

SL Colonies will assist in building projects and keep ownership of all resource based items that fit into the game. This is to ensure that if a sim ever decides to pull out of the RPG, these items come back into the game for use elsewhere and do not end up being traded and dispersed around to places that would greatly reduce the value of resources within the RPG.
