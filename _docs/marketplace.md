The Marketplace HUB is a virtual marketplace where players can use their SL Colonies coin to buy and sell in a regions central market. Players can create buy & and sell orders and make requests for items not available in that location. Traders can also go around seeding various locations to create supply & demand.

This is an essential for RPG sim owners who want to bring traffic in from other participants of SL Colonies. Treat the marketplace as an opportunity for your roleplayers to participate in import and export, opening the borders of your RPG to other roleplayers. Traders are required to visit your market in order to receive their items from buy orders, or their coins from sell orders.

**Price:** L$2,000<br>
