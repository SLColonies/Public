The water tower is a specialised gathering station to allow players to gather larger quantities of water in bulk than is normally permitted through our regular water scripts. 

The tower will fill up with water over time, and a player will be able to collect 240 units of water from the tower every 24 hours (or however much water has accumulated in the tower since its last use).

A player requires to use an Oak Barrel as a tool to collect water in bulk.
