Resources in SLColonies come in various forms. These are all your base ingredients and get registered into your characters virtual bag as a database item. Resources, also known as ingredients, are not physical objects and cannot be rezzed in world. 

> Resources differ in every RPG game using SLColonies. But if you'd like to learn about resources used in our main project [The Counter Earth](www.thecounterearth.com) - please visit its website [www.thecounterearth.com](www.thecounterearth.com) for more information.

Resources are used in the varous crafting tables as input ingredients. Crafting tables have special recipes setup which require a certain combination and number of ingredients. The output product of the crafting tables can either be a final product (which can be rezzed and used), or the output product could be another compound ingredient which needs to be further traded and crafted in order to get an end product, ie: a smithy might make arrow heads, but the carpenter might have prepared the arrow shafts which needs to be joined together for the end product - or, wheat might have been ground into flour, but it then gets used further by adding water, salt, eggs, milk and so forth to create various foods.

Resources are found in various places and forms and may require tools, whilst some can be gathered using bare hands.

There are some resources which can be gathered using bare hands while exploring the world. Such as picking up items off the floor like mushrooms, plants, flowers.

Then there is gathering that requires you to be equipt (or have another item in your player inventory) with the correct tools in order to perform the action. For example:

- Clay, which is used to craft jars which carries water and milk, requires a shuvel for digging.
- Iron Ore, which is used to craft all types of tools & weapons, requires a pickaxe for mining.
- Logs, which are used to craft tools & equipment, requires a lumberjack axe for chopping trees.
- Wheat, which is further processed into flour, requires a sickle for harvesting. 
- Milk, which is s staple ingredient to make various foods, requires clay jars for filling into.

Some gathering is instant by just left clicking to gather. While some gathering requires your avatar to perform actions, like mining requires you to wait a period of time while your character 'mines' the ore, before it gives you the resource and that node will deplete. Same with clay, trees and so forth.

Some resources are farmed, like wheat. The fields require a starter ingredient, like fresh water which you will hold in clay jars. Once watered, the fields will commence to grow over a period of time, which could be minutes, hours or days depending on the RPG setup. This goes for any type of farming fields, herbal gardens, pot plants, fruit trees, fermentation processes etc.

Other resources are found by hunting wild animals or slaughtering domesticated farm animals and will give you meats and furs or feathers etc depending on animal type. Some animals give no edible meats, but give other in-demand resources used to make other items (think tusks, bones, body parts for grinding and making into powders, potions, poisons etc).
