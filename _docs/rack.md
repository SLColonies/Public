The Leather Rack is specific to the Ranger profession only. Other professions cannot use this station.

It includes a mini-game where Rangers can create Leather & Parchment Paper from Prepared Hides which have already gone through the process of Leather Tanning through the Leather Tanner station.

Leather is used in making certain weapons and weapon parts. It is also used on certain furniture and certain clothing items which the Seamstress & Carpenter will require. 

Leather can also be turned into Parchment Paper which is required to make copies of Drafts, Plans, Patterns and more in the Engineering Table.

**Price:** L$600<br>
