While Sim Owners with a Region Server receives the colony system for free as part of the package, we are offering this essential addon for players that would like to create their own colony/clan/group/family within a sim that they are a member of. 

This system allows you to create a group, name it as you like and control your member's titles, profession names and more!

The Colony System is really good for lands where there are multiple factions to reside within who will trade with each other or war with each other.
