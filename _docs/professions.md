There are many professions within SL Colonies. All professions have particular tasks which they specialise in when it comes to gathering, farming & crafting. No one profession can do absolutely everyting.

One problem we saw with a lot of systems out there in Second Life is that people with a lot of L$ and a lot of time up their sleeves could setup mass production farms and make everything a system has to offer on their own - flooding the markets and drowning the economy with inflation and over supply.

SL Colonies aims to fix this issue by requiring players to pick a profession and earn their way up by crafting and doing tasks in that profession. As you work in your profession, you will gain skill points which will give you new titles/ranks. As you rank up, you will gain benefits: e.g. access to new recipes, slower crafting times, higher yields, reduced trading & travelling costs just to name a few. 
Should players switch professions, all skill points reset to zero and the player must work their way back up.

This also opens the game to lots of roleplay and trade potential. A new RPG sim will have positions vacant for players to take on, people will have to travel from place to place in order to get the materials they require to produce for their profession.

## Base Skills
All players have base skills regardless of profession chosen. This is to enable everyone to make the starting tools required to actually get started in the game if they are not available elsewhere. These are basically your base survival skills to get out and about and actually survive. These skills do not require you to use a crafting table in order to craft and get started.

### Craft Stone Pick Axe
This tool will enable you to get started if you are interested in getting into the mining profession (more on that profession later). It has low durability and is just enough to get you going. You will need the right amount of wood and stone to craft this tool.

This tool will enable you to get started if you are interested in getting into the woodsman profession (more on that profession later). It has low durability and is just enough to get you going. You will need the right amount of wood and stone to craft this tool.

### Craft Cooking Fire
With some stones and wood, you can craft yourself a cooking fire which you can use to cook basic food from. This will come in handy for those living out in the wild such as outlaws and hunters (or just anyone really). Fishing & Cooking go hand in hand.

### Build Tent
With wood and reed you can build yourself basic sleeping requirements for out in the wild. When you find yourself exhausted and tired, pull out a tent with a small bed inside and have yourself a rest to regenerate.

### Build Fishing Rod
Craft yourself basic fishing rods with wood and reed as your string, a little wooden hook to attach some bait to such as worms and have yourself a go at fishing around the various fishing zones on the lands available. Fish can be cooked and eaten to remove hunger.
