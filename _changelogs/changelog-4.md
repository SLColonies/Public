**Tools Menu:**<br>
Players now have access to tools. These tools make use of experiences in that they can be automatically attached to your avatar in order to perform a task requiring that tool. 

Tools can be crafted using their relevant crafting stations.

The tool menu will give players the following options:
- Get Tool:
	- This button will search the players virtual bag for an item which is considered a tool. If one is found, you can select which tool you would like to get. It will 'pull' the tool from your virtual bag and a regions server will send a prim version of that tool to your player HUD.
-Use Tool:
	- This button will search your HUD inventory for a tool you have sent to it using the 'get tool' function. If one is available within your HUD and you use this option, that tool will automatically rez and attach to your avatar. You'll then be able to perform the task requiring that tool, whether it be gathering, crafting, gardening etc.

**Region Server:**<br>
A region server has been created. This will allow sim owners to register their land with SL Colonies. This will also act as the main tool server in that it allows players to use the 'Get Tool' function from their HUD on that land. The region server contains all the prim copies of the tools and will transfer items from the server into players HUD contents for use. 

**Gatherables:**<br>
An exciting update is the Gatherables patch! Now players can explore the worlds and gather items they find around the land. Some items can be gathered by hand simply by clicking on the item, whilst some require a tool to gather, such as jars to gather water, a pickaxe to mine an ore node!

Gatherables also have spawn points. Sim owners are able to set up to 10 random spawn locations for all their gatherable resources. This means that when a resource is depleted, the item will vanish, and then after its set respawn timer, it will appear at one of the random spawn locations set in the object!

- General Resources:
	- Simple resources which players can gather by hand. These include stones, sticks, berries, fruit, mushrooms, plants and more.
- Tool Based:
	- This is useful for resources such as ore nodes requiring a pickaxe for mining. Or trees requiring an axe to chop down. 
- Farming Fields & Gardens:
	- Farming has been enabled. Fields of many types can be made. Example is a Wheat Field. Require a tool such as a plough made by the carpenter profession. This tool allows you to plough the untill soil. Once done, you would need seeds to plant into the tilled soil. Once you have seeded the field or garden, you will need to water it. Once it has been watered, the field or garden will begin to grow. On completion of growth, you can harvest your field or garden, whether that be done by hand, or require another tool, such as a sickle, is left to the imagination!
