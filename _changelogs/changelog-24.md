- Personal campfire added to the tools menu. You can now sit on a chair to regenerate energy over time. You can also use the campfire as a basic cooking station, to cook things like caught fish.
- Compass System. You can now search for different types of gatherable items on a sim, such as fungi, small flowers, twigs, twine and much more. The compass will pulsate a colour in the direction an item may be to hint to you how far and in what direction you are to the item to be found. Stay tuned for easter egg hunts!
