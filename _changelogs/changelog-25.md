{% include tag.html tag="security" %}

- This is a forced update, all older versions of the HUD will no longer work.

{% include tag.html tag="fixed" %}

- Timer system has been fixed. Now instead of the 60 second timer when going from OOC back to RP mode taking 10 seconds, it will really take 60 seconds.
- Other miner bug fixes.

{% include tag.html tag="added" %}

- Auto updating system to the HUD. When you attach a new copy of a HUD, the system will automatically reclaim all of your tools and deliver them into your HUD. You do not need to be wearing the old HUD to perform an update anymore.
- New campfire design.

{% include tag.html tag="changed" %}

- The compass is no longer a part of the HUD. It is now a seperate attachment which comes with the new HUD & Meter package. This is so that the Compass can be used anywhere on the grid, regardless if that sim has the SL Colonies experience enabled.
