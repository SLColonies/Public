- New region server with updates to tool scripts made to work with the new Sim Items system.
- Sim Items System now includes the ability for server admins to include energy consumption & gathering timer to gatherable items at a database level. Removing the need to update objects and have builders have to replace all their gatherable items to update. This also gives server admins the ability to balance the game as required based on supply & demand.

The gathering timer lets a player know how long he must remain in the vacinity of the gatherable item in order to complete the task. If they move away, the task will be cancelled.
