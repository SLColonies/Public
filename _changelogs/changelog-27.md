{% include tag.html tag="changed" %}

- Menu's now cleaned up. You will see in the menu descriptions what each button does. This fixes an issue where if an item name was too long, it was hard to determine what that ingredient was just by looking at the icon description.

{% include tag.html tag="added" %}

- PvP option. This feature is coming soon and will let you toggle PvP on and off for dueling and fighting only when you permit it for your RP purposes.

- Weapon Claiming. This feature is a placeholder for the full weapon system release coming this week. Players will be able to craft weapons and have the prim weapon sent to them for use on animals, monsters and dungeon system coming soon! Stay Tuned!

{% include tag.html tag="fixed" %}

- Various bug fixes in the background.
