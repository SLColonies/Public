**Domestic Animals:**<br>
These animals can be purchased from an NPC breeder. They allow farmers to gather resources from them periodically. For example, from cows you could gather milk every 4 hours. From sheep you might be able to gather wool from them each week which is used further in a loom to make twine.

Domestic animals can also be slaughtered to gather their meat type, however, keep in mind that SLColonies is not a breeding system, so the death of the animal will be permanent and you will need to visit an NPC breeder in-game to purchase more for coin.

**Huntable Animals:**<br>
Huntables, or wild animals, are the types that you can find out in the wild while exploring lands and gathering resources. These animals will either run away in spotting you, or, they will chase you and try to kill you.

On killing these animals, the hunter profession will receive CXP for doing so. Any other profession will not be rewarded with CXP as they get their CXP by crafting their specific items based on their profession. These animals also drop their carcasses which can be further processed to different meats, furs, organs, bones and so forth used in the various other professions - such as butchery, enchanting, potions.

**NOTE:** All animals will be able to have random spawn locations set. On death, they will spawn at one of these random locations on sim which is set up buy the object owner. This will make it more fun for hunters, knowing that animals will not always be where they first spawned. You can set up to 10 locations sim wide.
