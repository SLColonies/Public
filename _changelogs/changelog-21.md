- Energy meter now has a more fluid feel. Your energy will instantly drain and recover as you run and fly.
- Taking off your meter after consuming your energy by running or flying will not reset your energy.

{% include tag.html tag="fixed" %}

- /5on and /5off now work as intended. Coming back into /5on after going AFK will give the player a 1 minute count down to prevent people switching while crafting.
- Taking off your meter while crafting, gathering or farming will not ignore your energy usage. Items now communicate directly with the database and will remove your energy even if your meter is not attached.
