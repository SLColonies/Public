**Weapon Durability:**<br>
All weapons crafted have durability, just like tools. The main difference is that weapons can be repaired using a Repair Bench. 

Don't allow your weapons to hit 0 durability though, or they will be completely broken and unusable and complete unrepairable. 

Durability slowly drops as you use your weapons.

**Weapon Sharpness:**<br>
Weapon Sharpness is the stat which determines the maximum damage your weapon will produce when hitting something. At 100% sharpness, your weapon will cause 100% damage to your target. If your sharpness is 50%, damage will be halved. 

You need to keep your weapon sharp in order for it to be effective. You can sharpen weapons using sharpening wheels.
