**Merchant Vendors:**<br>
Merchant Vendors allow players to setup vendors to buy and/or sell various items.

These vendors can be set as single items vendors to sell what the player is crafting within small stalls. Or, they can be setup to be more like an NPC shop keeper which will buy and/or sell various items listed within the vendor.

Players can adjust buy and sell prices on the fly using the web based inventory listing.
