**Crafting Stations:**<br>
Crafting stations have been added to the game. Players will be able to use the various resources which they have gathered to make numerous items out of them in the different types of crafting stations. Crafting stations include carpentry, smithing, flour mills, cooking and many more. 

There is no limit to what we can do here!

**Rezzable Foods:**<br>
Not only can food be eaten directly from your HUD, but players that enjoy roleplay environments such as setting up dinner feasts with friends in taverns and homes can now do so. Certain foods have been set to be rezzable items and they can be layed out in-world for anyone to eat and regenerate certain stats. 

**Brewery Kits:**<br>
Brewing crafting stations have been added to the game. These will take input ingredients and after a set period of time, will allow collection of finished product. These products include rezzable barrels of acoholic beverages which tavern keepers can set a 'coin' price for. Players visiting these locations will be able to buy a single serve of the drink and be poured a virtual beverage served in hand while having meaningful discussions with their friends.
