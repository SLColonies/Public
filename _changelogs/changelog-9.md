**Marketplace HUBs:**<br>
Marketplace HUBs allow both sim owners and leaders of villages/towns/cities to setup a marketplace in their in-world market area.

This is fully web driven and allows for players of the Trader/Merchant Profession to travel to various lands using SLColonies to purchase low and to sell higher at a profit in lands that have more of a demand.

Traders will earn Craft XP (CXP) when participating in trade, level up and get the ability to place more and more buy orders and sell orders on the market.

Non-trader professions will be able to see what is available in the markets and purchase directly from sale orders and fulfill orders placed by other players. Non-trader professions however will have limited trades they can accomplish per day.

This marketplace will highly encourage players to travel the various sims using SLColonies in search of rare items or to sell their items where another market might not have as much of a demand or activity.
