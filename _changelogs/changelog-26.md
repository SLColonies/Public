- The compass now comes with 'modify' permissions to allow the user to resize this HUD to suit their display.

{% include tag.html tag="added" %}

- HUD now displays a 'coin name' next to the coin icons. This is in preparation for a new feature where every region will have the ability to have their own coin should they so desire. When a region is using their own coin, for example 'Dragoons', then on entry to that sim, your HUD will display 'Dragoons' on your HUD and change your available coins to that in the display for that particular coin. 

This will not affect your SLC Coins. Any coins you will own in future will be as different types of coins and will show in your web portal. 

The Market HUB's will use the global coins (SLC) - whilst all other systems, such as the Rental, Vendors, Drink Dispensors will have the ability to use a sim specific coin. This will enable for sim owners to generate their own coins, be responsible for their own inflation and value of coins and have their own economy within their own lands not influenced by the rest of the system.

Sim owners (or coin owners) will be able to sell coin for coin. So, you will be able to sell your coin, ie: Dragoons for SLC coin using both the Market HUB or the Vendors setup as 'Exchanges'. Whether someone purchases your coin using SLC coin at the value you set will depend on whether the buyer believes your exchange rate is fair.

Sim owners with this control will also be able to setup 'wages' and paid jobs on their land with their own coin should they so choose. 

Stay tuned for the release of more items to make use of this new system!
