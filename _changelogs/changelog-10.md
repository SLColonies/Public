**Rental Servers:**<br>
This Rental System is made for roleplay purposes and is not intended to be sophisticated like proper full fledged rental server which take L$. This system takes the roleplay coins only and has some unique features, including:

- Main Server: Used for a sim owner or the 'king' of a zone of land. With the main server, you can set a TAX rate, rez sub rental servers and rental units.

- Sub Server: This is intended to be used by land leaders, or village leaders who are not as high as a king or owner of a sim. Anything paid to rental units rezzed by this unit will have the TAX rate set on the main server automatically taken from the payment and sent to the main server's owner.

- Rental Unit: These can be rezzed for houses or shops on land. Your roleplayers will be able to add rental periods to these units by paying using SLC coins. Coins will go directly to the Sub Server owner (village leader) with a TAX also sent automatically to the Main Server (ie: King).
